Brief Description:

IT Equipment Reservation Helpdesk (ITRH) aims to design and build software application that would serve as IT Equipment Log of an organization. The system will be used for assisting borrowers for their requested equipment’s details. Employee who wishes to borrow equipment must first inquire to the ITRO who would verify equipment’s availability. If available, reservation of time and date would follow. If not, borrower could view the log of reserved equipments to see who he can make arrangements with.


Objectives:

The goal of developing this software is to provide solutions for common issues from traditional hand-written reservations:

    *      Redundant reservation of items
    *      Know who’s accountable for the equipments borrowed incase of damaged or lost
    *      View the quantity of available, reserved and borrowed items

Scope and Limitations:

The system is intended to help IT group handle reservation of equipments.It will be installed to a network folder of IT group only. Entertaining of requests is assigned to one IT staff at a time. A report generation option is available to provide hard copy for documentation and analysis purposes on usage statistics of IT equipment, demand vs availability, seasonal usage, and condition status of IT equipment. It is a help desk system that is unavailable for employees. Help desk is not a web-based application and does not require internet connection. Changes in equipment's details means an update to the database should be made by an authorized staff.
